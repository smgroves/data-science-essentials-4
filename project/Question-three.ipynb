    "Finally, TN Med Helper is trying to identify specific subpopulations to focus more attention on. Using data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, build a model to predict whether an individual has not had a checkup in the last year. Apply this model to the counties you identified above to predict how likely it is that the average person from those counties has not had a checkup in the last year. Which groups within these counties might need to be focused on to maximize the impact of TN Med Helper's efforts?"
